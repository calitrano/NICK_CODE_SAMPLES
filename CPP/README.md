Earlier in my career when C# started being widely used we were instructed to convert all existing code from C++ to C Sharp. Hence, most of my code examples would have been something I was working on in my own time, however C# learning always took precedence. 
Coding would have been connecting to databases and pulling off data. Processing files, using regular expressions, sanitizing data, manipulation of data such as special characters or correcting input errors on data keyed in manually by users and creating output files that could be consumed by other 4GL languages for reporting like Excel, Access etc.
